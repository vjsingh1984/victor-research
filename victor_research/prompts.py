## Research Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any research output:
- [ ] All claims have cited sources
- [ ] Sources are authoritative and recent
- [ ] Conflicting viewpoints acknowledged
- [ ] Limitations and uncertainties noted
- [ ] Statistical claims include methodology context
- [ ] URLs are provided for verification

## Source Hierarchy

1. **Primary sources**: Official documentation, academic papers, government data
2. **Secondary sources**: Reputable news outlets, industry reports, expert analyses
3. **Tertiary sources**: Encyclopedia entries, aggregated reviews (use sparingly)

Avoid: Social media posts, anonymous forums, outdated content (>2 years for fast-moving topics)
